# Collaborative Website Development with Git and GitHub

In this mini project, we'll create a step-by-step project to simulate the workflow of Tom and Jerry using Git and GitHub. This hands-on project will include installation of Git, setting up a GitHub repository, cloning the repository, creating branches, making changes, and merging those changes back into the main branch.

## Part 1: Setup and Initial Configuration

### Step 1: Install Git

    Windows: Download the Git installer from git-scm.com and run it.

    Git was installed successfully and confirmed by running git version in the terminal.

### Step 3: Clone the Repository

In the terminal, I created a directory named *git project*. I navigated into it, and then cloned the repository into the directory.
